### 2D_texture_array_averager.tox - 2D Texture Array Averager
This will take a 2D Texture Array (from a Texture3D TOP) and add the layers together according to a geometric distribution. If the falloff is F, the most recent layer is weighted by 1.0, the second most recent by 1.0*F, the third by 1.0*F^2 and so on. If F is 1.0, then the result is like a Box Filter over the Cache (every layer is weighted equally). If F is 0.0, then only the most recent layer is shown.

### bitpacking.toe - Bitpacking
Convert a 16-bit R-channel to 8-bit RGBA (you need half has many pixels). Convert a 16-bit RGBA to 8-bit RGBA (you need twice as many pixels). There are also examples for converting in the opposite direction.

### bloom_filter.tox - Bloom Filter
My version of a bloom filter based on what I've read and seen in a few places. It thresholds an image, blurs it, levels it, and adds that top of the original image. It has two stages. The second stage uses the first blur pass as its input rather than the thresholded image. In this way, the blur is cumulative.

### color_palette_bch_trigonometric.tox - Color Palette BCH Trigonometric
http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm Use the TOP to CHOP to figure out what the parameters do. This uses the BCH color space. Behind the scenes it uses some extra trigonometry, but you can try to keep the parameters between 0 and 1. The final clamp occurs in RGB space.

http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm Use the TOP to CHOP to figure out what the parameters do.
