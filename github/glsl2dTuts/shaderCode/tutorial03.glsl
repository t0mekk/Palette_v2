	Hi! I started learning GLSL a month ago. The speedup gained by using
	GPU to draw real-time graphics amazed me. If you want to learn
	how to write shaders, this tutorial written by a beginner can be
	a starting place for you.

	Please fix my coding errors and grammar errors. :-)

	Getting your bearings with GLSL can be a bit of a rodeo when
	you're first getting started. Uğur's 2D tuts were a huge help to me
	when I was first getting started, and they often show examples
	that are a little more granular than The Book of Shaders. 

	Hopefully this set of examples will help you get started and 
	get your gl bearings here in Touch.

	When possible, I've copied the examples as faithfully as possible.
	What that means is that there may be better ways to approach some
	challenges - but what you'll find here is as close to the original
	tutorial as I can manage.

// fragColor" should be assigned a vec4 object, which is made 
// of four numbers between 0 and 1.
// First three numbers determines the color, and fourth number
// determines the opacity.
// (For now changing the transparancy value will have no effect)
// A "vec4" data object can be constructed by giving 4 "float" arguments,

// uniforms
uniform float uTime;

// functions


out vec4 fragColor;
void main()
{

	// Uğur Güney
	// Here we are seperating the color and transparency parts
	// of the vec4 that represents the pixels.
	vec3 color 		= vec3(0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
	float alpha 	= 1.0;

	// TDOutputSwizzle is a TouchDesigner function that helps ensure 
	// consistent behavior between mac and pc versions of touch. What's
	// important to know here is that you need to provide this function
	// with a vec4. Because our example above doesn't consider alpha, 
	// we can construct a vec4 out of our variable color, and an additional
	// value of 1.0 for the alpha channel.
	fragColor 		= TDOutputSwizzle(vec4( color, alpha ));
