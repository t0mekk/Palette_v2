	Hi! I started learning GLSL a month ago. The speedup gained by using
	GPU to draw real-time graphics amazed me. If you want to learn
	how to write shaders, this tutorial written by a beginner can be
	a starting place for you.

	Please fix my coding errors and grammar errors. :-)

/*
	Getting your bearings with GLSL can be a bit of a rodeo when
	you're first getting started. Uğur's 2D tuts were a huge help to me
	when I was first getting started, and they often show examples
	that are a little more granular than The Book of Shaders. 

	Hopefully this set of examples will help you get started and 
	get your gl bearings here in Touch.

	When possible, I've copied the examples as faithfully as possible.
	What that means is that there may be better ways to approach some
	challenges - but what you'll find here is as close to the original
	tutorial as I can manage.

// How to draw a shape on top of another, and how will the layers
// below, affect the higher layers?
//
// In the previous shape drawing functions, we set the pixel
// value from the function. This time the shape function will
// just return a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 to indice the
// shape area. Later that value can be multiplied with some color
// and used in determining the final pixel color.

// A function that returns the 1.0 inside the disk area
// returns 0.0 outside the disk area
// and has a smooth transition at the radius

	float distanceFromCenter = length(r-center);

	float insideOfDisk = 1.0 - outsideOfDisk;

	// TouchDesigner provides us with a built in variable
	// that already holds the uvs for our texutre. Normally we'd 
	// you'll see this done other places with fragcoord and the
	// resolution of the scene. We could similarly derive this value
	// like this:
	// vec2 r 		= gl_FragCoord.xy / uTD2DInfos[0].res.zw;
	// here gl_FragCoord provides the pixel value, and uTD2DInfos[0].res.zw
	// provides the xy resolution of our first input.
	//
	// Lucky for us, TouchDesigner provides a built in uniform that 
	// already does this for us - vUV.st
	// for now we'll continue to use Ugur's method, but in the future
	// you'll see that I replace this computation with the line below.
	//
	// Sometimes we need values scaled between -1 and 1 rather than 0 and 1.
	// Since vUV.st is already normalized, we can do this fiarly eaisly 
	// by multiplying this value by 2, and subracting 1.
	//
	// Additionally, we don't always have square viewports, here we can construct
	// a vec2 that will hold an aspect multiplier for both x an y.
	// Next we need to multiply r by aspect. 
	//
	// The results of this will be hard to see here in our square examples, 
	// but try it on your own to see how it works.

	// TDOutputSwizzle is a TouchDesigner function that helps ensure 
	// consistent behavior between mac and pc versions of touch. What's
	// important to know here is that you need to provide this function
